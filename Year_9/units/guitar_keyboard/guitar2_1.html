                <p><i>An example of guitar TAB Symbols</i></p></div>
                <h2>What Do Symbols Mean on Guitar TAB</h2>
                <p>Now that you know what the lines and numbers represent on Guitar TAB, let’s look at the important symbols used.</p>
                <br><p>Symbols on Guitar TAB represent different guitar techniques such as slides, bends, hammer-ons, palm-muting, and more. When you see a symbol in Guitar TAB, it is telling you to perform a specific type of technique.</p>
                <br><p>There are two sets of symbols to learn for Guitar TAB. Text-based Guitar TAB uses one set of symbols and formal Guitar TAB uses a different set of symbols.</p>
                <br><p>Let’s go through all of the main symbols you will likely see in Guitar TAB.</p>

                <h3 class="border">What does h mean in Guitar TAB</h3>
                <p><strong>‘h‘</strong> in Guitar TAB is short for ‘hammer-on’. This is when you play a note and hammer-on to a higher note.</p>
                <p>In text-based Guitar TAB this is shown as ‘h’ in between two notes. In formal Guitar TAB, this is shown as a curved line over the two notes as shown below and an H above the staff:</p>
                <div class="image"><img src="../../images/guitar_and_keyboard/hammer-on-guitar-tab-h-symbol.jpg" alt="" class="img-style"></div>
                <p>Both of the above Guitar TABs are showing the exact same thing to play.</p>
                <br><p>2h4 means play the 2nd fret, then hammer-on to the 4th fret. 2h4h5 means to do two hammer-ons in a row (you only pick the first note).</p>

                <h3 class="border">What does p mean in Guitar TAB</h3>
                <p><strong>'p'</strong> in Guitar TAB is short for ‘pull-off’. This is when you play a note and pull-off to a lower note. It’s basically the opposite of a hammer-on.</p>
                <div class="image"><img src="../../images/guitar_and_keyboard/p-symbol-guitar-tab.jpg" alt="" class="img-style"></div>
                <p>The same curved line is used in formal Guitar TAB as is used for hammer-ons, so you simply need to look at whether the number is higher or lower to know which technique to use.</p>
                <br><p>Hammer-ons and pull-offs can be combined (known as <i>legato</i> meaning "smoothly") all under the same curved line.</p>
                <div class="task"><h3>Your Turn</h3>Have a go at playing the hammer-ons and pull-offs in the example below. Have patience, it can be tricky.</div>

                <div class="video"><h3>Video</h3>Watch the following video to learn more about how to play both hammer-ons and pull-offs

                </div> 

                <h3 class="border">What does / or \ mean in guitar TAB</h3>
                <p>A slash ( <strong>/ </strong>or <strong>\ </strong>) in Guitar TAB is the symbol for a slide.</p>
                <br><p>The type of slash used tells you whether you need to slide up to a note ‘/’ or slide down to a note ‘\’.</p>
                <br><p>To know which slash symbol is which, think of the slash symbol as a slide you walk up to from the left. If the slash slopes downwards like \, you slide down on guitar. If the slash slopes upwards like /, you slide up on guitar.</p>
                <div class="image"><img src="../../images/guitar_and_keyboard/slash-symbol-guitar-tab.jpg" alt="" class="img-style"></div>
                <p>The same symbols are used in text-based and formal Guitar TAB so it’s easy to identify slides. Some old text-based Guitar TAB may show s instead of a slash (eg: 7s5).</p>
                <br><p>In formal Guitar TAB, you may also notice a curved line over the top of the slide, this is a reminder that you only pick the first note of the slide. If there isn’t a curved line, it means to pick both notes.</p>



                <div class="end-notes"><h3>Lesson Thoughts:</h3>
                <p>TAB symbols help to decribe different ways of playing music. They can be tricky to play at first; however, like most things, the more you practice the better you will get.</p>
