        <h2>What is TAB?</h2>
        <p>Guitar TAB (or tablature) is a way to write guitar music that represents the positioning and strings to play and in what order. It is incredibly easy to understand once you know what all the symbols and numbers mean.</p>
        <br><p>In this lesson we will go through how to read Guitar TAB that you might find on websites such as <a href="https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/" class="text-link">Ultimate Guitar.</a></p>
        
        <h2>Guitar TAB Layout</h2>
        <p>The first thing you need to understand with Guitar TAB is the basic layout.</p>

        <h3 class="border">The Lines</h3>
        <p>Guitar TAB has <strong>six horizontal lines</strong> to represent the six strings on the guitar.</p>
        <br><p>As you can see in the diagram below, the six lines match up to the six strings on your guitar:</p>
        <div class="image"><img src="../../images/guitar_and_keyboard/how-to-read-guitar-tab-lines.jpg" alt="" class="img-style"></div>
        <p>Looking at Guitar TAB is like looking down at your guitar in your hands. The bottom line in Guitar TAB matches the lowest pitch string (low E) on your guitar.</p>
        <br><p>Text-based and formal Guitar TAB sometimes displays the string tunings for each line as shown below:</p>
        <div class="image"><img src="../../images/guitar_and_keyboard/text-based-guitar-tab-lines.jpg" alt="" class="img-style"></div>
        <p>The key point to remember is that the <strong>top line</strong> on Guitar TAB matches the <strong>highest pitch string</strong> on your guitar and the lowest line matches the lowest pitch string on your guitar.</p>

        <h3 class="border">The Numbers</h3>
        <p>Each line on Guitar TAB matches a string on your guitar. Whenever you see a number on a line in Guitar TAB, it is an instruction to play a specific note on that string.</p>
        <br><p>The numbers on Guitar TAB represent the fret numbers on a string. 5 would mean the fifth fret on your guitar. 12 would mean the twelfth fret. 0 would mean the open string (zero fret).</p>
        <br><p>Take a look at the below diagram for examples of different Guitar TAB numbers and how each number matches a note on the guitar:</p>
        <div class="image"><img src="../../images/guitar_and_keyboard/how-to-read-guitar-tab-numbers.jpg" alt="" class="img-style"></div>
        
        <br><p>There are two ways numbers can be written in Guitar TAB and it affects the way you play them.</p>

        <h2>The Order of Playing Notes</h2>
        <h3 class="border">Numbers Stacked on Top of Each Other</h3>
        <p>When numbers on Guitar TAB are stacked on top of each other, it is telling you to play those numbers at the same time. In other words, strum a chord.</p>
        <div class="image"><img src="../../images/guitar_and_keyboard/guitar-tab-chords.jpg" alt="" class="img-style"></div>
        <p>All of the above numbers in the Guitar TAB are stacked on top of each other and if you play them all at the same time, you end up with a chord.</p>
        <div class="task"><h4><img src="/images/task-guitar.svg" alt="" class="icon">Your Turn</h4>Take a look at the below Guitar TAB and think about what is being played (or try to play it yourself):</div>
        <div class="image"><img src="../../images/guitar_and_keyboard/guitar-tab-strumming.jpg" alt="" class="img-style"></div>

        <p>While it may look confusing, it is simply asking you to strum an E minor chord eight times. (Note: We will look at chords in a later lesson)</p>

        <h3 class="border">Numbers Written Left to Right</h3>
        <p>When numbers are written side by side (on the same string or different strings), the Guitar TAB is telling you to play the notes one after the other from left to right.</p>
        <br><p>We read Guitar TAB just like you’re reading this sentence – from left to right one word at a time.</p>
        <br><p>In the below Guitar TAB, you start by playing the 1st fret note, then play the 2nd fret note, then the 3rd fret note, and finally the 4th fret note because they are all written one after the other.</p>
        <div class="task"><h4><img src="/images/task-guitar.svg" alt="" class="icon">Your Turn</h4>Play through the following 4 notes on your guitar. Think carefully about which string it is asking you to play it on.</div>
        <div class="image"><img src="../../images/guitar_and_keyboard/guitar-tab-left-to-right.jpg" alt="" class="img-style"></div>
        <p>You should be able to hear that the pitch moves up in semi-tones. With this skill learnt, it's time to try a song!</p>

        <div class="task"><h4><img src="/images/task-guitar.svg" alt="" class="icon">Your Turn</h4>Time to learn your first song on guitar! See if you can play through "Twinkle twinkle Little Star".</div>
        <div class="image"><img src="../../images/guitar_and_keyboard/twinkle_twinkle.jpg" alt="" class="img-style" style="margin-left: 15%;"></div>


        <div class="end-notes"><h3><img src="/images/lesson-thoughts.svg" alt="" class="icon">Lesson Thoughts:</h3>
        <p>It doesn’t matter if you see a single-note or a chord, read everything left to right.
            The key point to remember is that you only play a string on your guitar when you see a number on that string.
            If you don’t see a number on a string, it means not to play anything on that string.</p>
